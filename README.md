A comprehensive prediction of the electrical properties of graphene, independent of field-effect transistor (FET) fabrication, could accelerate the development of graphene wafers and electrode materials. Such a capability may also enable the implementation of in-line inspection techniques during production. In this study, as a preliminary step toward predicting electrical properties solely from images, the relationship between carrier mobility and graphene surface roughness was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Although no correlation was observed between arithmetic mean roughness (Sa) and carrier mobility, persistent homology analysis—a mathematical framework that captures topological connectivity—revealed distinctly different persistence diagrams for samples with nearly identical Sa values but differing carrier mobilities. It was found that graphene structures conforming to pronounced substrate undulations, rather than convex features such as wrinkles or bubbles, led to decreased mobility. This study serves as a foundational investigation, demonstrating the potential to predict the electrical properties of graphene using only surface morphology images, made possible through the application of persistent homology analysis.
